### front end
To install Expo:
1. `npm i --global expo`
2. `npm i --global expo-cli`

To run: `npm start` (in `mobile/prescriptify`)

### react-app

### Express server:
To install dependencies:
`npm install`
in __react-app__ folder

### React frontend:
To install dependencies:
`npm install`
in __client__ folder (which is under react-app folder)

To run, you need two terminals:
1. Start the express server: `npm start` under __express-server__ folder
2. Start react frontend: `npm start` under __react-frontend__ folder

The files are set up for react to proxy to backend server for api calls.
